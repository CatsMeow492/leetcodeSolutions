# Problem
Given the root of a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (i.e., symmetric around its center).
# Intuition
We can use binary tree traversal algorithms to determine if the sides of the tree are symmetric. We can use a recursive algorithm to check if the left side of the tree is equal to the right side of the tree.
# Approach
We can use a recursive algorithm to check if the left side of the tree is equal to the right side of the tree. We can use a helper function to check if the left side of the tree is equal to the right side of the tree. The helper function will take in two nodes. The helper function will return true if the left node is equal to the right node and the left node's left child is equal to the right node's right child and the left node's right child is equal to the right node's left child. The helper function will return false if the left node is not equal to the right node or the left node's left child is not equal to the right node's right child or the left node's right child is not equal to the right node's left child.
