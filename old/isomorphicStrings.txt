# Approach
For this problem we're asked to check if charectors in a string S can be replaced 
to get string T. Example:
```
Input: s = "egg", t = "add"
Output: true
```
## Intuition
We can imagine that we will likely have to break the strings into an array
and count the number of times each charector appears. We can then compare
if there is a charector in s that appears the same number of times as any
charector in t appears. If there is, we can return true. If not, we can return
false.
## Psuedocode
```
function isIsoMorphic
    create map for S
    create map for T
    for each charector in S
        if charector is not in map
            add charector to map
        else
            increment value of charector in map
    for each charector in T
        if charector is not in map
            add charector to map
        else
            increment value of charector in map
    for each charector in S
        if value of charector in S map is equal to value of charector in T map
            return true
        else 
            return false
