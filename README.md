# leetcodeSolutions

Pretty simple, just the solutions to the leetcode problems I do daily.

# I've started describing my conceptual approached in .md files before I actually attempt the code. I also add notes to these .md's if I'm later able to find faster solutions. These notes contain information on the algorithms used and their time complexities.
